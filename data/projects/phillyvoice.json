Being an entirely new organization, they could build a platform      with no legacy requirements or technical debt. They came to Tivix with the need for a media site, a high-fidelity set of mockups, and an open mind.</p>  <p>It was clear that a CMS would be needed to allow PhillyVoice's content creators to quickly post stories and photo galleries with ease. We settled on the Wagtail CMS, because it offers great content management functionality, and being      built on top of Django and Python, we could easily leverage our expertise to add the additional features PhillyVoice required.&nbsp;These include a complex unstructured tagging system, native &amp; third party ads and a host of clever      workflows to support a large number of staff creating, editing and publishing simultaneously. The consumer UX/UI is optimized across platforms and browsers including mobile devices and IE8 among the usual suspects.</p>  <p>Launched on January 8th, 2015,&nbsp;today PhillyVoice.com's team of 30 individuals plus 25 contributing authors publish 30 to 40 articles a day, that have attracted more than 4 million unique visitors sincelaunch.</p>  <p>Tivix continues to develop new features to help PhillyVoice.com deliver fresh, dynamic content to its users as quickly as ossible.</p>  <p><b>Technologies used: Django, Wagtail, AWS, Fastly, Lesscss.</b></p>"
