A genuine autodidact, Francis has been writing software code since the age of 12. Today he is one of our leading experts in Python/Django/Javascript, and is known for rapidly learning and applying new ideas and technology to projects.

He serves as Technical Architect on some of the most complex client engagements at Tivix.

> In his spare time, Francis likes to juggle, play games, make games, and collect science fiction novels. He also loves a good road trip and once drove from San Francisco to the Grand Canyon in a weekend, just for fun.
