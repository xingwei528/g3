                        <p>We're a software consulting firm. Our job is to help our clients build <a href="http://www.tivix.com/blog/building-software-matters/">software that matters</a>.</p>
                        <p />Our ethos is encapsulated in our internal motto: <em>Get shit done</em>. Itâ€™s what our clients expect of us, and what we expect of our teammates.&nbsp;It also represents what we believe good software should do.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>We're selective about the engagements we take on, because we want client engagements where we legitimately add high-leverage value. Sticking to engagements that align with core expertise allows us to move fast, be productive, and add
                            value quickly.</p>
                        <p>Getting a job at Tivix is hard. But if we hire you, we're all-in on making you a success.&nbsp;We have high standards for our work and our team.

                        </p>
                        <p>We place a high value on keeping our internal communication <b>fluid, honest, supportive, and detailed</b>. We primarily use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> for internal communication because it's fast and collaborative.
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>We also place a high value on our communication with clients. We want every client to feel that the contact they have with Tivix is <b>the most professional and productive communication</b> they've ever received.</p>
                        <p>We are headquartered in <b>Silicon Valley</b>, with offices in <b>NYC</b>, <b>Portland</b>, and <b>Europe</b>. We make sure to use the time zone and cultural differences to our advantage, and never let them be a hindrance.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><b>We believe in doing things right and treating people well.</b> If we nail that, everything else will follow.</p><b />
